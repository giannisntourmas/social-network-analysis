# social-network-analysis
A Python project that was developed as a university assignment for the subject of Social Networks.
In this project we compute Degree Centrality, In-Degree Centrality, Out-Degree Centrality, Closeness Centrality, 
Betweenness Centrality, Eigenvector Centrality and Katz Centrality using the NetworkX librar and we make predictions based on these metrics.
